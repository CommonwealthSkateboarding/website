	      <p>Commonwealth works closely with Skate Like A Girl PDX, a non-profit dedicated to teaching women and young girls how to skate and provide a fun, comfortable environment to earn those first skateboard bruises. Skate Like A Girl conducts regular skate clinics at Commonwealth <strong>on the first and second Sunday of each month</strong> from 9:30AM&ndash;1:00PM, as well as occasional ladies-only skate sessions, outdoor events and camps.</p>

				<p>Skate Like A Girl handles their own clinic registrations and all proceeds benefit their non-profit. Information and Registration can be found on <a href="http://www.skatelikeagirlpdx.com/#!clinics/c13y0" target="_blank">their Skate Clinics page</a>.</p>
